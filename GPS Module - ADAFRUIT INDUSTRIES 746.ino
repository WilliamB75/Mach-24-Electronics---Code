/*
If you want to write the code in standard C, without using the Arduino framework or libraries, 
 you would typically need to handle the low-level communication with the GPS module and parsing 
 of NMEA sentences yourself. Below is a simple example in standard C using a hypothetical 
 scenario. Please note that in a real-world application, you may need to adapt this code based 
 on the actual communication protocol of your GPS module and handle the NMEA sentences accordingly.

Keep in mind that the initSerial, readChar, and writeChar functions would need to be implemented 
based on the hardware you are using for serial communication. Additionally, the parseNMEA function 
needs to be customized based on the NMEA sentence structure and the information you want to 
extract. Always refer to the datasheet or technical documentation of your specific GPS module for 
accurate details on the communication protocol and NMEA sentence format.
